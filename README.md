PWA Training with my personal notes and labs.

## Intro

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) help developers to provide native-app qualities in web applications that are reliable, fast, and engaging.

PWA is not an API or a technology, but it is a web development approach that uses a combination of tools and technologies to create ideal user experiences.

## Understand your audience and content

How do you start thinking about building an app or a website?

You should understand your target and audience:

- Audience
- Platforms
- Connectivity
- Data cost
- Usage contexts
